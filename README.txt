The purpose of this project is to create a simulation of Langton's ant 
on an infinite scale. The ant was replaced by a snail for the purpose of the 
class project. 

The snail begins on a central square. Before each square is discovered, the square will 
appear as the color black. As the snail lands on a square, it will be assigned a  
delta-orientation based on the color of the square. Each square has its own set of colors and 
delta-orientations. The snail will then rotate based off of the delta-orientation and then move
one square forward. 

Executing the Program: 
After opening the program in an IDE or command prompt with python installed, 
run the program and type 1 for a slow framerate or 2 for a fast framerate. A separate window 
will appear on your screen and display the simulation.
