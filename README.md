# Langton-s-Ant-Simulation-\

## Simulation description
The purpose of this simulation is to represent Langton's Ant Algorithm (the ant is representd by a snail in this example). The snail initially starts over a board of black tiles. As the snail lands on each tile, it reveals the color of the tile, and based on the color of the tile the snail's direction is altered by an assigned delta-orientation. The sanil will the move one square forwards and the process will continue. 

## Running the simulation
After running the simulation, the terminal will prompt the user to enter either 1(for a slower framerate) or 2(for a fast framerate). After that, a window will automatically open and run the simulation.
